Responsible

The Climate Action Tracker warns the world is heading towards a warming of 2.4°C or higher within this century, if only 2030 targets are met. The economically disadvantaged populations are already at risk and their economic and social development is put at further risk if schools are not comfortable places where students are able to concentrate and learn.

Some attempts to provide schools in such areas do not appear equipped to manage this coming challenge (arch daily, 2011). Although, more recent projects may fare better, it is still not clear if the overall U-value of these buildings conforms to local or international standards or indeed if any energy-modelling was carried out prior to construction (arch daily, 2019).

Purposeful

Therefore, we decided to create a simple and accessible, U-Value calculator specific to Mozambique. Mozambique was chosen because one of our team was already engaged in a project aimed at keeping girls in school in this location (Girl MOVE Academy, 2023). Furthermore, our skills as a team lie in this area and we could be confident in our design and selection of materials.

Additionally, by using renewable materials available in Mozambique, our tool challenges unsustainable construction practices by quickly demonstrating the improved comfort levels when compared to designs that use traditional, unsustainable materials such as concrete. Our research has established that current local building codes are dated or do not contain the required information necessary to inform adequate construction. Therefore, by adopting an International Energy Conservation Code Standard as a baseline, new designs that use this calculator can attempt to conform to an approved standard in the absence of local codes (Cruz et al, 2020).

Inclusive

Current iterations of this tool are not inclusive, do not include sustainable materials and are prone to bias. Often, online tools require users to be licensed BREEAM professionals or for a request for calculation to be made by a supplier likely to favour their own materials. In addition, online calculators are configured towards North-American and European climates (changeplan, 2023). Therefore, due to Mozambique’s lack of building or energy codes, there is the requirement to establish an applicable baseline rating for schools based on its own climate. Users of our tool do not need professional licencing and require only knowledge of building dimensions and materials in order to evaluate a design.

Similar energy-rating practices in the UK are regulated by The Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government. A suitable roadmap for this tool would be to have the Mozambique equivalent office host, maintain and update periodically the tool’s materials library in order to preserve its independence.

We envisage local architects being able to model the energy performance of their designs quickly without requiring expensive software or foregoing the process altogether. By including renewable materials only available in Mozambique, the same local stakeholders should benefit from constructions that utilize this tool. It will not exclude existing suppliers and contractors. 

Regenerative

We specifically chose one tool for one country in order to focus the scope of our submission. However, only short coding changes are required in order to change the baseline to another standard or country and to add new materials.

From its original design, the tool has already evolved to calculate U-values from material thickness using thermal conductivity figures taken from academic sources (Asdrubali et al, 2015, Costes et al, 2017, Cruz et al, 2020). Additional proposals include adding a cost calculator that could provide rough estimates on designs and to ultimately host the tool as a desktop app rather than on Google Colab.
